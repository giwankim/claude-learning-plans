# Claude Learning Plans

Structured, multi-week learning curricula for senior engineers who want deep mastery of backend, infrastructure, and systems topics.

## Overview

This repository contains 30 self-paced learning plans generated with Claude. Each plan follows a phased, project-based format designed for working engineers — typically 12–16 weeks of focused study with curated resources, hands-on milestones, and progressive complexity. Topics range from Spring Boot internals to Kubernetes, Go, and distributed data systems.

## How to Use These Plans

Each plan is a standalone Markdown file structured around:

1. **Phases** — Progressive stages from foundations to advanced topics, typically spanning 12–16 weeks.
2. **Milestones** — Concrete projects and exercises at each phase to validate understanding.
3. **Curated Resources** — Books, documentation, talks, and blog posts selected for each topic.

Pick a plan that matches your current learning goal, work through the phases at your own pace, and use the milestones to gauge progress.
